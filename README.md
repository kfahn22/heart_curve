# Shader code for a heart curve

## I am trying to work out how to create a fractal flame shader. As a first step I am trying to write the code for the different variations used by Daniel Shiffman in his [FractalFlames](https://github.com/CodingTrain/FractalFlame) repo.  There are many ways to render a heart in a shader. Inigo Quelez has a sdf for a [heart curve](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/) on his website.  Additionally, Martijn Steinrucken (The Art of Code) has a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXyPOLf2MbU) where he renders a heart shape. I wanted to use an approach more similar to the one taken by Daniel Shiffman, so I started with his equations and played around with the formulas until I was able to render a decent heart shape.
