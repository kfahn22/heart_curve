# Shader code for a heart curve

## I am trying to work out how to create a fractal flame shader. As a first step I am trying to write the code for the different variations used by Daniel Shiffman in his FractalFlames repo.  There are many ways to render a heart in a shader. <a ref="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/">Inigo Quelez</a> has a sdf for a heart curve on his website.  Additonally, Martyn (The Art of Code) has a tutorial where he renders a heart shape. I wanted to use an approach more similar to the one taken by Dianel Shiffman, so I started with his equations and played around with the formulas until I was able to render a decent heart shape.
